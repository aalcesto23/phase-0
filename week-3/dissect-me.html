		<h1>GPS 1.2: The Anatomy of HTML</h1>
		<section>
			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>
				Welcome to HTML Anatomy 101. In this class, you will do the learn how to dissect an HTML page from the &lt;head&gt; to the &lt;footer&gt;, add a new feature to Sublime Text, and mark up your previous blog posts with semantic HTML tags. So get your gloves on, open your textbook (the HTML docs (Links to an external site.)) and begin!
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Release 0: Set up</h2>
			<p>
				Before you can get started, you'll need to get setup for the challenge. Decide who is going to drive and who will navigate. Then each of you will need to:
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Create a feature branch in the phase-0 directory</li>
					<li>Using the command line, navigate to the week-3 directory</li>
					<li>Within that directory, (using the command line) create a blank HTML page called dissect-me.html.</li>
					<li>Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub. Create a quick pull request and merge the changes. </li>
					<li>SUBMIT your link to the dissect-me.html file as soon as you do this. This is how your guide will give you feedback. The URL should be something like: <a href="https://github.com/aalcesto23/phase-0/blob/master/week-3/dissect-me.html">https://github.com/[USERNAME]/phase-0/blob/master/week-3/dissect-me.html</a> (Links to an external site.)</li>
				</ul>
			<p>
				NOTE: You should decide whether to trade roles in each release or change roles half way through the session. If you decide to switch from release to release, you'll want to share code easily using a collaborative editor (or even a simple google doc).

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

The tags I used in this challenge are as follows:

<!DOCTYPE html>: I used this to declare that this document is a HTML document
<html>: I used this to declare that this document is a HTML document for the browser
<head> I use this as the container for all of the head information
<title>: I use this for the title of the document, which will appear in the tab in the browser
<body>: This is where you would enter the code/information of the document
<main>: This indicates the main information of a document within the body
<h1>: This is used for headers, which is helpful when indicating header of information/paragraphs
<p>: I used this to enter in text in a paragraph format
<section>: I use this to section off portions of my code, primarily text
<ul>: I use this for unordered lists

A lot of these tags are commonly used when creating a HTML document, and some manditory, so these will constantly be used.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The elements get laid out on the page in concerns to the flow of the HTML, which can differ. The order the browser uses to display elements works from the top, <html>, to bottom, </html>.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

In this challenge I learned how to use snippets and create new ones for future use, which saves a lot of time. Rather than typing out the basic format for type of document, I could use a snippet and then add additional code depending on its purpose. Because it is so useful, I will definitely be creating more snippets and researching other useful shortcuts that already exist.
