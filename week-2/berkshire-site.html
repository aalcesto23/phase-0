<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

The assignment was a little overwhelming at first, but it became a lot easier after breaking it down and working backwards. It was more manageable adding the text first, then adding the tags. I found myself looking at the site and making a list of tags that I would be using.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I thought it was relatively easy to find information on semantic HTML5 elements online. There are so many sites that provide lists of the different elements and how to use them. It took more time learning how to apply the elements to your own code than finding them.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I think my partner and I did well in keeping to best practices, keeping in minimal.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

A good thing about HTML is that there are a lot of resources out there for people that are just starting to learn, such as myself. Since I have not worked with a lot of different languages, it is hard to point out something bad about HTML, since I do not have much to compare it to. What I did find difficult was keeping track of where I am in my code, especially when adding tags at a later time. HTML code looks very condensed, so it is easy to lose your place or when spotting errors.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I made a list of common tags to help me remember them, so I can easily recall them when I am coding. I think the best way to remember how to write HTML is to constantly use it, that way it just becomes second-nature after a while (I have yet to reach that point).
