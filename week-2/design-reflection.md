What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The purpose of this website is to show future employers and anyone else willing to read about me and my experience. My website will feature my work history, background, passions, past/current projects, and as well as my ongoing blog.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience is interested in web and software development. My site will adress these interest through my web/software development projects and my blog on different facets of web/sofware development and technology.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I think that the primary action would change depending on the type of visitor. For futuer employers I would want them to look at my professional work history in my "About Me" section and look at my projects to judge my work. For average visitors I would like them to look at my projects and blog to provide feedback and possibly take away some knowledge.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Design and user experience in concerns to a system can dictate how a user feels about the information and/or product you are providing. Both the user experience and design of a website should revolve around your audience and what you want to convey to that audience, so designers should always be mindful how they present that information.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

User experience design is a design that can provoke how a person feels when interacting with a system, and is often time user-centered. User experience design aims to make systems easy and pleasant to use, while still providing value to the system. This is valuable in the way it makes the services and/or information your system provides more accessible to users, while providing a pleasant experience that they can associate with your services and/or information.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

To be honest, I did not find any of the parts of the challenge to tedious. All the releases seemed essential and the readings were informative.
