<!-- Add your reflection here -->

<!-- What did you learn about the DOM? -->

<!-- DOM is essentially adding CSS to HTML through JavaScript. Like CSS, you link your JavaScript to an existing HTML document, but through a script imbeded in the HTML document.

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?

I think the most used method is .getElementById to access elements, from that point you can manipulate it as needed. Another useful method is .style which allows you to apply style elements to the element. -->
