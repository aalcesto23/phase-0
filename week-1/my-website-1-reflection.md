Describe what open source means.

Open source means to share how a program was made and allow anyone to customize it on a needs basis.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I do not think open source would make sense for many products, as it would make it difficult for companies to keep track of the integrity of their product. Though I feel this way about some products, I do see the benefit. With open source knowledgeable people can contribute to products, making them better and more efficient. 

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Essentially, licenses protects one's work. It prevents or allows others to use your, change, and distribute your work.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I always struggle with creating a pull and merging my files. It was not exactly an "aha" moment, but I think after following the process multiple times in previous challenges has made it a lot easier to follow without referring to notes.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
