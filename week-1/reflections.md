# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?

One of the most important pieces of information I took away from the various articles was to create a learning environment that will allow you time to reflect on your work, and give self-praise for your efforts. This idea stems from the "Fogg Method," and by doing this it will provide motivation to work and stimulate productivity through building upon tiny habits. Ideally, these habits will work toward a long term change in improving your time management and productivity while working.
What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?

Time Boxing is allotting a specific amount of time to steadily work on completing a task, rather than continuously working on the task until completion. It can be applied to Phase 0 by previously agreeing upon an amount of time to work on an assignment . This will provide time to reflect on one's work and come back with fresh thoughts, rather than forcefully producing results. Also, Time Boxing can assist in managing one's time to ensure certain assignments are given the correct amount of time needed to complete them.
How do you manage your time currently?

Currently, I tend to procrastinate on work as a defense mechanism due to a lack of knowledge or fear of failure. Since I procrastinate, I will leave all the work up until the very last moment actions need to be made or things need to be submitted.
Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?

I don't think that my current strategy is working. This strategy puts a lot of stress on me to complete assignments, so I tend to focus solely on finishing, even if that means not retaining the information. A lot of times during college I would pull all-nighters to study for an exam the night before, then after taking the exam I'm unable recall any of the information I studied. Though, I enjoy working under pressure and it helps me focus, I want to implement a strategy that will break the habit of cramming information and not learning anything from it.
Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?

I will focus on Time Boxing my workload through out my time at DBC, and hopefully in my future work place. Specifically for DBC, I will evaluate my weekly assignments at the start of each week and Time Box the assignments with the suggested amount of time in mind to allow myself to take breaks and evaluate my work. This will allow me time to celebrate my success and look into my failures for opportunities to grow.
What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?

I plan to create good habits to keep myself motivated to work and avoid procrastinating. I want to provide myself time to really think about the things I am working on by building that into my schedule/time management. Overall, I am going to space out my work so I can work comfortably, while retaining the information and staying productive.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

What is a shell? What is "bash?"

A shell is a user interface used to access an operating system to manage a computer's hardware/software. Bash is the command language interpreter.
What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

The most challenging was making sure I did not miss any lines of code, such as something as simple as the ../ command, which result in me back track through my code. Also comprehending the video was difficult without any prior knowledge to the subject. I needed to re-watch the video after going through the tutorial, which helped me understand the material.
Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

I was successful, but some exercises took much longer than others (rmdir, less, more, and cat). Though I was able to follow the steps, it will be sometime before I can remember all of the commands and navigate through the terminal freely. 
In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

I think that grep is an important command that will save users a lot of time and effort. Rather than randomly searching through a text file, grep can narrow down the search fields. I also think Wildcard matching is an important tool when making changes to various files all at once, rather than doing them all manually.
Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does?

pwd: to print working directory

ls: to list directory

mv: to move a file/directory

cd: change directory

../: refers to the parent directory

touch: creates an empty file

mkdir: makes a directory

less: pages through a file

rmdir: removes a directory

rm: removes a file

help: a command that helps find out information on other commands

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?

Instructions:

Creating a new Repo: Before following instructions please ensure that you join Dev Bootcamp on GitHub.

- login with your username and password onto GitHub

- click on the "+" top right hand corner

- from the drop down menu click on "New repository"

- enter in the repository name into the field

- mark "Public" to the right of the icon

- from the "Add a license" drop down, select MIT License

- click "Create repository"

Forking a Repository: Before following instructions please ensure that you join Dev Bootcamp on GitHub.

- login with your username and password onto GitHub

- from the Dev Bootcamp repository list on GitHub, click on the repository you would like to fork

- in the top right hand corner, click "fork"

- a secondary window will open prompting you to select the account you would like to for the repository

- click on your profile

Cloning a Repository: Before following instructions please ensure that the repository you are trying to clone has been forked via GitHub and you have an existing directory to store the information.

- login with your username and password onto GitHub

- select forked repository

- copy HTTPS clone URL located on the bottom right hand side

- open up terminal 

- enter cd (name of directory) into terminal

- enter git clone (HTTPS clone URL)

The reason why you would fork a repository as opposed to creating a new one is to ensure you are not affecting the original file. Instead, you will be able to work on the file and make changes without applying those changes to the original file. Also, this saves time in creating a brand new repository/file if you are building off of an already existing one.
What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

I did not have too much trouble setting up git and GitHub, especially with the written instructions and tutorial video being so informative. I never created a repository, forked it, and cloned it before this assignment, so learning this process is all new to me. It was a relief to see how easy GitHub makes it to take these actions. Also it was interesting cloning the repo via the terminal, rather than following the manual prompt on GitHub, which helped reinforce previous assignments using the command line.
