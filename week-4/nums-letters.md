Numbers

What does puts do?

Puts writes onto the screen whatever comes after it, so it will return nil and pring the output to the console with a new line.

What is an integer? What is a float?

Integers are numbers without a decimal point and floats (short for floating-point numbers) are numbers with decimal points.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Division with floats will return an output with floats, while dividing with integers will return an output rounding down to the nearest integer. So for floats if your take 5.0/2.0 you will get 2.5, but for integers 5/2 you will get 2 because it is rounding down to the closest integer. Dividing with integers is useful when calculating when the answer can't be a franction of a whole.

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby handles addition and subtraction similarly to a calculator. You would use the "+" to add numbers and "-" to subtract numbers. For multiplication you would use "*". You would use "/" to divide numbers.

What is the difference between integers and floats?

Integers are whole numbers, without decimals following, while floats have a decimal followed by numbers. An example of this would be 4 as an integer, and 4.55 being a float.

What is the difference between integer and float division?

When dividing an integer and the product is not a whole number, the product will round down to the nearest integer. For example, if the product is 4.5, the product of an integer would be 4. For floats, the product will remain a float.

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

A string is group of letters in a program. Strings can contain punctuation, digits, symbols and spaces in them as well. You can use strings to shorten the process of typing something out. For example you can set name = 'Alan Alcesto'. This way when you puts = name it will return 'Alan Alcesto' rather than typing it out each time.

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Variables are used to store a string into your computer's memory for use later in a program, also known as assignment. Variables are the names of the assignments. The first character of a variable in Ruby needs to be a lowercase letter.

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

The challenge was a good refresher of the Ruby I learned for by DBC interview. Since I learned most of this information at an earlier time, the challenge wasn't too difficult, but necessary for me to get my mind back on track for Ruby.
