Numbers

What does puts do?

Puts writes onto the screen whatever comes after it, so it will return nil and pring the output to the console with a new line.

What is an integer? What is a float?

Integers are numbers without a decimal point and floats (short for floating-point numbers) are numbers with decimal points.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Division with floats will return an output with floats, while dividing with integers will return an output rounding down to the nearest integer. So for floats if your take 5.0/2.0 you will get 2.5, but for integers 5/2 you will get 2 because it is rounding down to the closest integer. Dividing with integers is useful when calculating when the answer can't be a franction of a whole.
